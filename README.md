# A-Neuro-Symbolic-Program-Integrity-Auditor-for-Python-C-and-C++
A Neuro-Symbolic Program Integrity Auditor for Python, C, and C++ is an intelligent system designed to automatically audit source code for logical correctness, structural integrity, and rule consistency. Unlike traditional tools that focus only on syntax errors or coding style, this system analyzes the deeper logic of a program using a neuro-symbolic approach. It combines symbolic reasoning—such as rule verification, control flow analysis, constraint checking, and logical validation—with neural network–based pattern recognition to detect hidden flaws, inconsistencies, unreachable code, unsafe conditions, and logical contradictions. By understanding both the structure and intent of the code, the system generates detailed analytical reports and highlights potential vulnerabilities or integrity violations. This makes it highly useful for secure software development, academic learning, code review automation, and research in intelligent program verification.
